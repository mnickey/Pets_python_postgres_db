Pets_python_postgres_db
=======================

Demonstrated use on using python to import a CSV, normalize it and create a queryable database.

Using the python script, we can add the csv into a postgres database. 
While this example is small in size it shows us that we can not only add the keys & values, but we can also add foreign keys and use base python structures to manipulate the data as needed.
